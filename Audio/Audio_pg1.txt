	This is a test of the i.MX53 audio input / output systems. There are three parts to the test. You will be asked to report the results of each after each part finishes.

    The first part will play 'pink' noise for ~12 seconds. Pink noise is designed to sound as though 
no specific tone is being played. If you hear a distinct tone, or hear no noise at all, please report
this as an error.

    The second part will play a familiar sound clip. If the sound is distorted (or if there is no sound)
please report this as an error.

    The third and last part will record a short audio clip using the available audio input and then play
the clip back. Pleae speak or make some noise when you are prompted.
