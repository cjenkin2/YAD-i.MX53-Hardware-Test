	The following test will record 10 seconds of audio from the default audio input device. Please speak or otherwise make some noise during this time (e.g. "Testing, testing 1 2 3.")

After 10 seconds have elapsed, the recorded audio will be played back to you. You will then be asked whether there were problems with the recording.

Press 'OK' to continue, 'Cancel' to return to the main menu.
