	This is a test of the i.MX53 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); it will cover several graphics libraries (such as OpenVG and OpenGL2). Each sub-test will display a pop-up window with some graphical animation from one of the available libraries that will close after a short period of time. After these you will be asked to report any problems or errors with the animation.

To begin, press 'OK'. To return to the main menu, press 'Cancel'.
