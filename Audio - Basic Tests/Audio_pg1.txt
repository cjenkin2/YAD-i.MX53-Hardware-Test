	This is one of three tests of the i.MX53 audio input / output systems. This tests has 4 parts, each lasting about 6 seconds. You will be asked to report any problems after each part.

	The first part plays white noise; the second part plays 'pink-noise', which is like white noise but should sound quieter and more uniform; the third part is a sine wave playing at 440Hz; the last part will play the same frequency as the first but in ticks.
