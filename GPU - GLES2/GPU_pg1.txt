	This is one of three tests of the i.MX53 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This test covers the GLES2 graphics libraries, and consists of two animations: first a 'torus' (a geometric figure that will render as a 3D knot) will scroll from right to left; then a triange with red, orange, and yellow gradients will spin. Each of these will take ~10 seconds.

	To begin, press 'OK'. To return to the main menu, press 'Cancel'.
