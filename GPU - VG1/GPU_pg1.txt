	This is one of three tests of the i.MX53 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This test covers the VG1 graphics libraries, and consists of two animations of a tiger's head. The first will spin against a blue background; the second will remain stationary against a grey background. Each animation should last ~10 seconds, after which you will be asked to report any problems.

	To begin, press 'OK'. To return to the main menu, press 'Cancel'.
